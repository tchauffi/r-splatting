# r-splatting

A Rust implementation for gaussian splatting using egui and wgpu.

## Description
This project aims to provide a Rust-based implementation of gaussian splatting, leveraging the capabilities of the `egui` library for GUI rendering and `wgpu` for GPU acceleration. The goal is to create an efficient and user-friendly application for visualizing and manipulating gaussian splatting techniques.

## Dependencies

- [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) - Immediate mode GUI library
- [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) - Safe and portable GPU abstraction
